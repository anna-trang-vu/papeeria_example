abstract = {The gas injection system (GIS) is an indispensable part of ITER fueling system. It deliveries the necessary gas species from tritium plant to vacuum vessel, pellet injection system or neutral beam for plasma operation and fusion power shutdown. In this paper, the current design status of GIS, including the previous design changes, is briefly described. As the GIS design justification and support, the experimental study on GIS response time is illustrated. The factors delayed the GIS response time are identified, and two kinds of control mode are proved to be effective for improving the GIS response time. The exploration on magnetic shield design shows the discrepancy of shielding performance occurs in the case of the paralleling external magnetic field to the sample cylinder. These R&D works prove the design feasibility in some ways, and support possible solutions for design challenges as alternative design options.}

abstract = {In this paper we propose a dynamic feedback controller by adopting the interconnection and damping assignment passivity based control (IDA-PBC) method, to stabilize a class of weakly-coupled electromechanical systems. These systems are characterized by a weak coupling between the electrical and mechanical subsystems (dynamics) which limits the application of classical energy shaping control methods. The proposed design method incorporates a change of coordinates to construct the controller. It also introduces the use of an integral control and damping injection to the mechanical coordinates, to enhance the coupling between the subsystems, ensuring asymptotic stability, while improving the robustness of the systems against external disturbances and noise. The results are applied to two groups of systems; the electrostatic MEMS devices and the magnetic levitation. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the use and analyze the performance of the proposed control methods.}
